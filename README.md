# WWDC2019
I created this project with the objective of spread awereness among the terrible situation that our oceans could be find today. In this little game you're going to play as Art for a couple of minutes, like if you were a turtle swimming across the sea. You'll find out that even a little action like this, is a real world challenge for animals that are forced to live on the dirty oceans, that our way of life is creating.
So, join Art in his little everyday adventure, so he can show you a little more of his life, and how harmful even a little plastic straw could be.

This Project was submitted to WWDC 2019 Scholarships.
